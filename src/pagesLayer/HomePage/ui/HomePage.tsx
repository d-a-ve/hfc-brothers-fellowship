							Our Mission and Values
						</h2>
						<p className="~text-sm/lg">
							Society often portrays brothers, sons, and men as strong,
							self-sufficient individuals who can handle everything on their
							own. However, the reality is that they, too, experience joy,
							happniess, pain, sorrow, and feelings of being overwhelmed. They
							need guidance and support from their peers and mentors who have
							walked a similar path.
						</p>
						<p className="~text-sm/lg">
							The HFC Brothers' Fellowship is built on the foundation of
							brotherhood. Our goal is to foster a supportive community where
							men can come together, share their stories, struggles, and
							challenges, and learn from God's word and one another.
